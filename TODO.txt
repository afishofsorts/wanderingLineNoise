LEGACY/CLEANUP:
Remove time arrays, redundant if every function creates it's own based on Ts

Remove data storage

Make yaxes of plotAllTime consistent

Simplify PSOSegmenter w/ sub functions

RESEARCH:

Test PSOSegmenter runtime depending on number of segments

How to decide suitable w2 w3 bounds?

Get smooth Nseg variation curve (multiple runs?)

Use signal spectroscopy to find fmin and fmax for any data processing!

Make accessing segment fit parameters available
